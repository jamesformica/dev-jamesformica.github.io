So I joined a startup founded by two of my close friends. Going from 600 devs to 3 was actually quite exciting. I felt a bit of pressure early days to be a driving force behind the culture and having come from a team where the most anticipated part of the day was playing a highly modified version of paper, scissors, rock (Cowboy, Ninja, Bear) I figured I would follow suit.

So I built Build Off. A multiplayer game where you race to build your property as fast as you can while also gaining points. At the core of the game were cards. Some offensive and some defensive. Offensive cards would cause issues for other players such as causing a COVID outbreak on site or increasing material costs, whilst defensive cards would upgrade your tools or purchase insurance. But here's the kicker, it was a bit of a fail. The game wasn't balanced properly and there wasn't an obvious goal.

I learnt a lot and it was genuinely fun to build but if I were to do it again, I'd probably spend a bit more time fleshing out the story behind the game before diving in. Oh, and as for the culture at BuildPass, it's doing fine, we didn't need a game in the first place. At least, not yet...
